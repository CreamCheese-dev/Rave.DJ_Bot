THIS PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT AND STILL BUGGY

The Rave.DJ Bot is able to automate the process of typing and downloading two song mash-ups either from the user manually typing in the URLs to the script
or via a text file which the program can read to create the two song mash-ups.

Features:

Single Song Mashup: Enter a pair of YouTube URLs for on-the-spot mashup creation and download.
Bulk Processing: Use a text file with multiple URLs to automate the creation and downloading of numerous mashups in one go.
Error Handling: If a mashup doesn't process correctly, the tool will save the troublesome URL for later reference.
Automatic Downloads: As soon as a mashup is processed, it's downloaded to your local storage, eliminating the need for manual downloads.

Limitations:
As of now, it can only handle Youtube URLs.
Script can only handle processing two song mashups.
Error handling is still buggy.
Code is still unoptimized.
