EXPECT POTENTIAL BUGS!

The Rave.DJ Bot is able to automate the process of typing and downloading two song mash-ups or playlists from text files containing links from
Youtube or Spotify.

Features:

+ Two song mash-up and playlist support: Use a text file with 2 or a minimum of 10 URLs to automate the creation and downloading of numerous mashups in one go.

+ Automatic Downloads: As soon as a mashup is processed, it's downloaded to your local storage, eliminating the need for manual downloads.

+ Error Handling: If a mashup isn't processed in a timely manner, the program will save the Rave.DJ URL for later reference.

Limitations to be aware of:

- To use Spotify links, you need to login prior to using this script.
- Program can be a bit buggy when handling playlists with over 100 tracks involved.

How to use this program:

Simply have your tracks you want to mashup in a .txt and leave it at the directory of the program where main.py and downloader.py reside.
Program will ask what you are trying to automate, either a two song mash-up or a playlist. 
Downloads will appear on the same directory.
