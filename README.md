THIS PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT AND STILL BUGGY

The Rave.DJ Bot is able to automate the process of typing and downloading two song mash-ups or playlists from text files 

Features:

Two song mash-up and playlist support: Use a text file with 2 or a minimum of 10 URLs to automate the creation and downloading of numerous mashups in one go.

Error Handling: If a mashup doesn't process correctly, the tool will save the troublesome URL for later reference.

Automatic Downloads: As soon as a mashup is processed, it's downloaded to your local storage, eliminating the need for manual downloads.

Limitations:
Unable to do multiple two song mashups (Yet)
To use spotify links, you need to login prior to using this script. 
Error handling is still buggy.
Code is still unoptimized.
